{
int a[50],i,n,large,small;
cout << “\nEnter the number of elements : “;
cin >> n;
cout << “\nInput the array elements : “;
for(i=0;i<n;++i)
cin >> a[i];

large=small=a[0];

for(i=1;i<n;++i)
{
if(a[i]>large)
large=a[i];

if(a[i]<small)
small=a[i];
}

cout << “\nThe smallest element is ” << small << endl;
